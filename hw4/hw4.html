<HR>

<H2>Purpose</H2>

<P>This assignment uses the STL <CODE>map</CODE> container class, a
variety of STL algorithms, and some <CODE>string:iterator</CODE>s.</P>

<H2>Assignment</H2>

<P>In this assignment, you will write a C++ program that reads a text
file and collects a number of statistics about the words it contains.</P>

<P>Words in the input file are separated by whitespace, which is
defined as any combination of blanks, tabs, and newline characters.</p>

<P>For this program, you may use only STL algorithms, which means you
must use iterators. Do not loop through the input with a
subscript. Also, you may only use the C++ <CODE>string</CODE> class, so
do not use any old-style C strings (i.e., arrays of <CODE>char</CODE>).</P>

<H2>Program</H2>

<P>You will need to write a main program as well as the header files and
source code for the <CODE>Table</CODE> and <CODE>NumericTable</CODE> classes.</P>

<H3>The <CODE>main()</CODE> function</H3>

<P>Define a <CODE>Table</CODE> or <CODE>NumericTable</CODE> for each
of the following:

<UL>

<LI><p>Table 1: A table of distinct words in the input and their
frequency, case-sensitive.</p></LI>

<LI><p>Table 2: A table of distinct words in the input and their
frequency, case-insensitive. In other words, 'The' and 'the' would
count as distinct words in Table 1 but the same word in Table
2.</p></LI>

<LI><p>Table 3: Number of words in the input starting with each letter of
the alphabet, case-sensitive. In other words, the number of words
starting with 'a', 'b', etc.</p></LI>

<LI><p>Table 4: Number of <i>distinct</i> words in the input starting
with each letter of the alphabet, case-sensitive. In other words, the
number of words in Table 1 that start with 'a', 'b', etc. (Note that
there are multiple ways to obtain this data. You can iterate through
Table 1 if you like but you don't have to.)</p></LI>

<LI><p>Table 5: Number of times each letter of the alphabet is found in
the input, case-sensitive.</p></LI>

<LI><p>Table 6: The number of vowels, consonants and digits in the
file, case-insensitive. Consider the letters a, e, i, o, u to be
vowels and the other letters to be consonants. (The letter 'y' is
sometimes a vowel, but we'll ignore that for the moment.)</p></LI>

<LI><p>Table 7: The number of 1-letter words, 2-letter words, etc. in the
file. (The term "n-letter word" means a word of length n, regardless
of the makeup of the word.)</p></LI>

</UL>



<P>Your program should do the following:</P>

<UL>

<LI><p>Obtain the name of the input file from the command line.</p></LI>

<LI><P>Use the input extractor (the '>>' symbol) to read words from
the input file. The input extractor will separate words based on
whitespace.</p></LI>

<LI>Use the following rules in sequence to obtain a canonical form for
each word. These rules are simpler than the full set of rules needed
to parse English text, but they will give you a feel for the type of
rules required. Write your rules using STL <CODE>algorithms</CODE>
such as <CODE>find</CODE>, <CODE>remove</CODE>, <CODE>replace</CODE>, 
<CODE>transform</CODE> and <CODE>for_each</CODE>, among others.

<UL>

  <li>Remove all of the double quotes (") from the word.</li>

  <li>If a word starts and ends with a single quote ('), remove both
  quotes. Do not remove any other single quotes.</li>

  <li>If a word ends in a comma or period, delete the final
  punctuation mark.</li>

  <li>If a word consists of all numeric digits with the possible
  exception of a comma, replace the comma by a period.</li>

</UL>
</p>
</LI>

<LI>Use the <CODE>add</CODE> function for each table to
increment the correct entry in that table.</P></LI>

<LI>After the input is finished, use the <CODE>print</CODE> function
for each table to print the table as described below.</P></LI>

</UL>

<H3>Class <CODE>Table</CODE></H3>

<P>The <CODE>Table</CODE> class contains the following data members:</P>

<ul>
<li><P>A <CODE>map</CODE> container containing <CODE>pairs</CODE> of
type <CODE>pair&lt;string, int&gt;</CODE>. The first element of
the <CODE>pair</CODE> contains a key and the second contains its
frequency, i.e., the number of times a word matching the key occurs in
the input.</P></li>

<li><P>A count of the number of distinct items added to the map. This
  number should match the size of the map.</P></li>

<li><P>A count of the number of items, not necessarily distinct, for which
data has been added to the map. This number should match the sum of
the frequencies in the map.</P></li>

</ul>

<H3>Constructor for <CODE>Table</CODE></H3>

<P><CODE>Table</CODE> has only one constructor, which takes no
parameters. It initializes the <CODE>map</CODE> and sets both the entry
count and the item count to zero.</P>


<H3><CODE>add</CODE> function for <CODE>Table</Code></H3>

<P>The <CODE>add</CODE> function for the <CODE>Table</CODE> class
takes one argument, a <CODE>string</CODE>. The
string is used to identify the table entry to be incremented.</P>

<P>Remember that a <CODE>map</CODE> keeps its entries in order sorted
by the first argument (the key). For a given <CODE>string s</CODE>
and <CODE>map m</CODE>, the statement</P>

<PRE>
m[s]++;
</PRE>

<P>will do one of two things. If the key <CODE>s</CODE> is not already
present in the <CODE>map</CODE>, it adds <CODE>s</CODE> to the map as
the key of a new entry and sets the value to 1. If the
key <CODE>s</CODE> is already in the <CODE>map</CODE>, it
increments the value stored for that key by 1 instead.</P>

<H3><CODE>print</CODE> function for <CODE>Table</Code></H3>

<P>The <CODE>print</CODE> function for the <CODE>Table</CODE> class
takes one argument, a <CODE>string</CODE>, which will be used as the
table header.</P>

<P>For each table, print a header line showing the table number and a
brief description. Skip a line after the header.</p>

<p>Also print two summary lines showing the number of entries and number
of distinct entries in the table. Skip a line after the two summary lines.</p>

<p>Then print the table entries 5-up (i.e., 5 per line).</p>

<p>All words must be left-justified and all numbers must be
right-justified in constant-width fields so that the tables are
printed in neatly aligned columns. For example, you could use 12 positions
for every word, a space between columns, 3 positions for each number,
and two spaces between columns.</p>

<P>Your output should look like this:</P>

<PRE>
Table 1: Case-sensitive words

  7 distinct entries
123 entries

aaa    6          bbb    1          etc.
f     10          gg    11
</PRE>

<p>Skip two lines after each table.</p>

<p>Make sure your code works correctly regardless of whether the last
line of your printout is full or not.</p>


<H3>Class <CODE>NumericTable</CODE></H3>

<P>The <CODE>NumericTable</CODE> class is identical to
the <CODE>Table</CODE> class except that it contains integer keys
instead of strings.</P>


<H2>Submission</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Use good object-oriented practices. Methods that do not alter the
class data should be declared <CODE>const</CODE>. Objects should
normally be passed by reference to save on overhead; if a method does
not alter the object, pass a reference to
<CODE>const</CODE> data rather than passing the object by value.</P></LI>

<LI>Remember that any auxiliary variables you define, such as
iterators, should be local to the function they are used in. They
should not be class members or global variables.</LI>

<LI><P>You must have a makefile with a rule for compiling an object
file for each source code file. A linking rule should link all of
your object files together to create one executable. The name of your
final executable should be <CODE>hw4.exe</CODE>. You should also
provide a "clean" rule.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Name your program <CODE>hw4.cpp</CODE>. Use the same naming
convention as previously for the <CODE>Table</CODE> class and its
header file.</P></LI>

<LI><p>Execute your program as <CODE>./hw4.exe
filename.txt</CODE>. Make up a one line file to test your program so
you can verify the counts yourself. Then you can try mine:
<A HREF="hw4-in1.txt">hw4-in1.txt</A> and
<A HREF="hw4-in2.txt">hw4-in2.txt</A>. 
You can see my answers here:
<A HREF="hw4-out1.txt">hw4-out1.txt</A> and
<A HREF="hw4-out2.txt">hw4-out2.txt</A>.
In my answers you can see that 'one'.->'one' due to the order of the
rules. That's a flaw in the specs; in a real world application, you'd
change the order of the rules to remove punctuation first. If you took
the initiative and did that, you'd get the same answers for file #1
and <A HREF="hw4-out2-fix.txt">hw4-out2-fix.txt</A> for file #2. Either 
answer is fine.</P></LI>

<LI>Your program must follow <i>all</i> the documentation standards
listed on the course web site.</P></LI>

<LI><P>As always, programs that do not compile on <KBD>turing</KBD>
automatically receive 0 points.</P></LI>
      
<LI><P>Submit your project using mailprog.340.  Submit the 5 files
you have written plus your makefile.</P></LI>
