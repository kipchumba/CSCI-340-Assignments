<HR>
 
<H2>Purpose</H2>

<P>This assignment builds on last week's assignment. It replaces the
  array and loop indices by the STL vector class and iterators. It
  also uses a command line argument to acquire the file name. The
  driver requires a copy constructor and an overloaded assignment
  operator to work properly.</P>

<H2>Assignment</H2>
 
<P>Make the following changes to your program from HW1.</P>

<H3>Using the STL vector class and iterators</H3>

<P>Replace the array in your player database by an STL vector of
  pointers to baseball players.</P>

<P>Where possible, use an iterator to loop through the vector.</P>


<H3>Good team and small team</H3>

<P>Your program will produce four output files. The first three
  include one for the original team, one for a team composed only of
  good players, and one for a small team. The fourth one prints the
  original team again. If you have coded your copy constructor and
  overloaded assignment operator correctly, the last output should be
  the same as the first.
  </P>

<p>Add the argument <code>ofstream& outFile</code>
  to <code>PlayerDatabase::print_team</code> to handle this. You will
  also have to make corresponding changes to
  the <code>BaseballPlayer</code>, <code>Pitcher</code>
  and <code>Hitter</code> classes.</p>

<p>Write a member function <code>void create_good_team()</code> to
  convert the team into a better one by removing all the players who
  are not considered good. We will define a good pitcher as one with
  an ERA less than or equal to 3.4950. We will define a good hitter as
  one with as a batting average greater than or equal to .2795.</p>

<p>Write a member function <code>void create_small_team()</code> to
  convert the team into a smaller one by deleting the first four
  players. Your code should work regardless of how many players are on
  the team: 0, less than 4, exactly 4, or more than 4.</p>

<p>Use suitable <code>vector</code> functions for each of these.

<p>If there are no pitchers or hitters available to calculate a team
  average, print "n/a".</p>

<p>Remember that the elements of <code>team</code> are pointers,
  so you must delete the <code>BaseballPlayer</code> objects in
  addition to removing the undesired elements from the vector.
</p>


<H3>File name entered as command-line arguments</H3>

<P>You will execute your program as</P>

<PRE>
./hw2.exe xyz
</PRE>

<p>where <code>xyz</code> is the prefix for your files.</p>

<p>The driver will call a function with signature</p>

<pre>
void create_names(int argc, char* argv[], string& iFileName,
    string& oFileNameAll, string& oFileNameGood, string& oFileNameSmall,
    string& oFileNameRepeat);
</pre>

to create the names for all of the files.</p>

<p>If the input name is <code>xyz</code>, the input will
  be <code>xyz.txt</code>. Build the output names
as <code>xyz_output_all.txt</code>, <code>xyz_output_good.txt</code>,
<code>xyz_output_small.txt</code>
and <code>xyz_output_repeat.txt</code>.</p>

<p>You can use the overloaded '+' operator to concatenate two strings.

<p>Write this function and include <code>create_names.h</code>
and <code>create_names.cpp</code> in your makefile.</p>

<H2>Submission</H2>

<UL>

<LI><P>You must have a makefile with a rule for compiling an object
file for each source code file.  A linking rule should link all of
your object files together to create one executable. The name of your
final executable should be <CODE>hw2.exe</CODE>. You should also
provide a "clean" rule.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Use the same naming convention as previously for each class
    and header.</LI>

<LI>A driver program for testing your database can be found here:
<A HREF="hw2.cpp">hw2.cpp</A><br>

  A very short file that you may use for input can be found
  here: <A HREF="mini.txt">mini.txt</A>.<br>

  A moderately short file can be found
  here: <A HREF="mid.txt">mid.txt</A>.<br>

  A more realistic file can be found here:
  <A HREF="full.txt">full.txt</A>.</p></LI>

<LI>Your program must follow <i>all</i> the documentation standards listed on
the course web site.</LI>

<LI><P>As always, programs that do not compile on <KBD>turing</KBD>
automatically receive 0 points.</P></LI>
      
<LI><P>Submit your project using mailprog.340.  Submit the 10 files
    you have written files (5 *.h and 5 *.cpp) plus your makefile.</P></LI>
