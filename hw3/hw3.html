<H2>Purpose</H2>

<P>This assignment reviews the binary tree data structure and the
STL <code>vector</code> class and introduces the STL
<CODE>stack</CODE> and <CODE>queue</CODE> classes.</P>

<H2>Assignment</H2>
 
<P>You will implement a binary expression tree class. You will build
  the tree from a postfix expression string using a stack.</P>

<H2>Program</H2>

<P>You will need to write the header files and source code for
three classes:</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>TNode</CODE> is a linked binary expression tree.</LI>

<LI>The <CODE>ExprTree</CODE> class points to the root of the tree.</LI>

<LI>The <CODE>Variable</CODE> class stores the names and values of the
variables in the expression tree. The <CODE>Variable</CODE>s are
stored in an STL <CODE>vector</CODE> which is a data member of
 <CODE>ExprTree</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Class <CODE>Variable</CODE></H3>

<P>The <CODE>Variable</CODE> data is used to store the name and value
of a postfix expression variable. To simplify coding, the only
variable names used in this assignment will be single capital letters.
</P>

<P>Because the data members of a <CODE>Variable</CODE> must be
frequently accessed by the <CODE>ExprTree</CODE> implementation, the
<CODE>Variable</CODE> class should declare the <CODE>ExprTree</CODE> class
to be a friend.</P>

<P>A <CODE>Variable</CODE> contains two data members. The first is a
<CODE>char</CODE> that contains the variable name. The second is a 
<CODE>double</CODE> that contains the variable's current value.</P>

<H3>Constructor for <CODE>Variable</CODE></H3>

<P><CODE>Variable</CODE> has only one constructor, which takes two
parameters, a <CODE>char</CODE> and a <CODE>double</CODE>. These
parameters are used to initialize the data members of the class.</P>


<H3>Overloaded <CODE>&lt;&lt;</CODE> operator for <CODE>Variable</Code></H3>

<P>Overload the <CODE>&lt;&lt;</CODE> operator for
the <CODE>Variable</CODE> class to print the two data members of a
variable, separated by a single space. As usual, you will need to
declare your overloaded operator function to be a friend.</P>


<H3>Class <CODE>TNode</CODE></H3>

<P>The <CODE>TNode</CODE> data structure is used as a building block 
to create a linked version of a binary expression tree.</P>

<P>Because the data members of a <CODE>TNode</CODE> must be
frequently accessed by the <CODE>ExprTree</CODE> implementation, the
<CODE>TNode</CODE> should declare the <CODE>ExprTree</CODE> class
to be a friend.</P>

<P>A <CODE>TNode</CODE> contains four data members. The first is a 
<CODE>char</CODE> that specifies the type of operator or operand
stored in the tree node. The second is a <CODE>double</CODE>
containing the value of an operand stored in the node. The third and 
fourth are pointers to a <CODE>TNode</CODE>, the roots of the left
and right subtrees of the node in the binary tree.</P>

<H3>Constructor for <CODE>TNode</CODE></H3>

<P><CODE>TNode</CODE> has only one constructor, which takes two
parameters, a <CODE>char</CODE> and a <CODE>double</CODE>. Give the
second parameter a default value of 0.0. The two constructor parameters 
are used to initialize the first two data members of the class; the two 
pointer data members should be initialized to a null value.</P>

<H3>Overloaded <CODE>&lt;&lt;</CODE> operator for <CODE>TNode</CODE></H3>

<P>Overload the <CODE>&lt;&lt;</CODE> operator for the <CODE>TNode</CODE>
class to print the data members of an expression tree node. If the type of 
the node is equal to <CODE>'#'</CODE>, print the value data member only. Otherwise,
print only the type of the node. As usual, you will need to declare
your overloaded operator function to be a friend.</P>

<H3>Class <CODE>ExprTree</CODE></H3>

<P>The <CODE>ExprTree</CODE> class stores the root of a binary expression 
tree and an external list of the expression variables.</P>

<P>This class contains two data members. The first is a pointer to
a <CODE>TNode</CODE>, the root node of the expression tree. The second
is an STL <CODE>vector</CODE> of <CODE>Variable</CODE> objects
containing the variable names in the expression tree and their values.</P>

<P><b>Note:</b> In implementing this class, you may want some additional helper
functions, especially if you use recursion. You are free to add any
private methods you wish to the <CODE>ExprTree</CODE> class. You may
not add additional data members.  You may not make any changes to
the <CODE>TNode</CODE> class.</P>

<H3>Constructors for <CODE>ExprTree</CODE></H3>

<P>The default constructor for the class should initialize the root
pointer to null. You should also write a second constructor that takes
a reference to a constant C++ <CODE>string</CODE> as its sole
parameter. This constructor should call the <CODE>build()</CODE>
method outlined below, passing the string to it.</P>

<H3>Copy constructor for <CODE>ExprTree</CODE></H3>

<P>The copy constructor takes a reference to a
constant <CODE>ExprTree</CODE> object as its parameter and should be
implemented in the usual fashion for a binary tree. In addition to the
tree itself, you will also need to copy the list of variables.  This
can be accomplished by assigning the variable list of the tree to the
variable list of the new tree, since the <CODE>vector</CODE> class has
a built-in overloaded assignment operator.</P>

<H3>Destructor for <CODE>ExprTree</CODE></H3>

<P>This function calls the <CODE>destroy()</CODE> method described
below, passing it the root of the expression
tree. The <CODE>vector</CODE> of variables already has its own
destructor that will be called automatically.</P>

<H3><CODE>ExprTree::clear()</CODE></H3>

<P>This method returns nothing and takes no parameters. It clears the
binary expression tree, releasing all of the dynamic memory associated
with the tree. It does not alter the <CODE>vector</CODE> of
variables. It should call the <CODE>destroy()</CODE> method, passing
it the root of the tree, and then set the root to a null value.</P>

<H3><CODE>ExprTree::destroy()</CODE></H3>

<P>This method returns nothing and takes a pointer to an expression
tree node as its sole parameter. The method should traverse the tree
and free all of the nodes. The logic here is basically a slightly
modified postorder traversal, so it is easiest to write this as a
recursive function. This method will not be called from outside
the <CODE>ExprTree</CODE> class, so make it private.</P>

<H3>Overloaded assignment operator for <CODE>ExprTree</CODE></H3>

<P>Standard approach applies. As with the copy constructor, the
<CODE>vector</CODE> of variables may be copied using a normal
assignment statement.</P>

<H3><CODE>ExprTree::build()</CODE></H3>

<P>This method returns nothing and takes a reference to a
constant <CODE>string</CODE> as its parameter. The string will contain
a postfix expression, with the tokens of the expression separated by
spaces. The method should build a binary expression tree from the
postfix expression string using an STL <CODE>stack</CODE> to
temporarily store the addresses of the tree nodes as the tree is
built.</P>

<P>There are a number of possible ways to break a string into
individual tokens in C/C++, and you may use any method you like. One
way is outlined in the <B>Implementation Hints</B> below.</P>

<UL>
<LI>For an operator token
(<CODE>+</CODE>, <CODE>-</CODE>, <CODE>*</CODE>, or <CODE>/</CODE>),
create a new tree node, store the token as the type and store 0.0 as
the value. Pop an address off the stack and store the address in the
new node's right link. Pop another address off the stack and store it
in the new node's left link. Then push the new node's address onto the
stack.</LI>

<LI>For an alphabetic variable name token, create a new tree node,
store the variable name as the type and store 0.0 as the value. Push
the address of the new node onto the stack.</LI>

<LI>For a literal number token, create a new tree node,
store <CODE>'#'</CODE> as the type and store the number as the value
(you'll need to convert the number to <CODE>double</CODE> format
first, of course). Push the address of the new node onto the
stack.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Once all tokens in the expression string have been processed, pop
an address off the stack and store it as the root of the expression
tree.</P>

<H3><CODE>ExprTree::evaluate()</CODE></H3>

<P>This method returns a <CODE>double</CODE> and takes no
parameters. It should compute and return the value of the expression
stored in the tree, or 0.0 if the tree is empty. The logic described
here is once again a modified postorder traversal, so you will most
likely want to write a recursive helper function to do the work. All
of the operands (literal numbers and variable names) in the expression
tree are stored in leaf nodes, while the operators are stored in
non-leaf nodes.</P>

<UL>
<LI>When a node with type <CODE>'#'</CODE> is encountered, return the
value of the node.</LI>
<LI>When a node containing a variable name is encountered, call
<CODE>getVariable()</CODE> to obtain the variable's value and
return it.</LI>
<LI>When a node containing an operator is encountered, traverse the
node's left subtree to obtain the value of the first operand, traverse
the right subtree to obtain the value of the second operand, perform
the type of arithmetic indicated by the operator, and then return the
result.</P>
</UL>

<H3><CODE>ExprTree::printInorder()<BR>
ExprTree::printPostorder()<BR>
ExprTree::printLevel()<BR></CODE></H3>

<P>Print the nodes of the tree to standard output in inorder,
postorder, and level-by-level fashion respectively. The first two are
easy to implement using recursive helper methods. For the inorder
traversal, we will print the infix version of the expression in fully
parenthesized form. To do this, print <CODE>"( "</CODE>, traverse the
left subtree, print the current node contents followed by a space,
traverse the right subtree, and finally print <CODE>") "</CODE>.</P>

<P>The level-by-level traversal should be implemented iteratively
(i.e., non-recursively) using an STL <CODE>queue</CODE> object to
store the node addresses as the tree is traversed.</P>

<H3><CODE>ExprTree::setVariable()</CODE></H3>

<P>This method returns nothing and takes two parameters,
a <CODE>char</CODE> variable name and a <CODE>double</CODE> variable
value. The method should declare an appropriate
<CODE>iterator</CODE>  and use it to perform a linear search of the variable list 
<CODE>vector</CODE> for the variable name passed in as a parameter. If
the name is found, replace the current value stored for the variable
with the new value passed in as a parameter. If the name is not found,
create a new <CODE>Variable</CODE> object with the new variable name
and value passed in as parameters and add it to the end of the
<CODE>vector</CODE>.</P>

<H3><CODE>ExprTree::getVariable()</CODE></H3>
   
<P>This method returns a <CODE>double</CODE> and takes one parameter,
a <CODE>char</CODE> variable name. The method should declare an
appropriate <CODE>iterator</CODE> and use it to perform a linear
search of the variable list <CODE>vector</CODE> for the variable name
passed in as a parameter. If the name is found, return the value
associated with it. If not, return 0.0.</P>

<H3><CODE>ExprTree::printVariables()</CODE></H3>
   
<P>This method returns nothing and takes no parameters. It should
declare an appropriate <CODE>iterator</CODE> and use it to traverse
the variable list <CODE>vector</CODE>, printing the values of
the <CODE>Variable</CODE> objects stored there.</P>

<H2>Implementation Hints</H2>

<P>One method to break a C++ <CODE>string</CODE> into individual
tokens is to use a <I>string stream</I>.  Since a string is just a
series of characters (just like a file or input typed at the
keyboard), you can create a stream object and associate it with a
C++ <CODE>string</CODE>, e.g.:</P>

<PRE>
   istringstream ist(expressionString);   // create an input string stream
   string token;         // string to hold individual token

   while (ist >> token)  // read a single token from the expression string stream
      {            
      // process the token
      }
</PRE>

<P>The <CODE>istringstream</CODE> class can be found in the C++ header
file <CODE>&lt;sstream&gt;</CODE>.</P>

<P>You can use an iterator or subscript with
C++ <CODE>string</CODE>s. You can also use some of the higher-level
functions available. (You can obtain the length of a string from
the <CODE>length()</CODE> method of <CODE>string</CODE>.)</P>

<P>A C++ <CODE>string</CODE> object can be converted to a C-style
null-terminated string using the <CODE>c_str()</CODE>
method <CODE>string</CODE>. There are several C functions that will
convert a C-style string to a <CODE>double</CODE>,
including <CODE>atof()</CODE>, <CODE>strtod()</CODE>,
and <CODE>sscanf()</CODE>. Check the online <CODE>man</CODE> pages for
details of these functions.</P>

<P>There are also many web sites available that cover the C++ Standard
Template Library classes and the C standard library functions; see the
course web page for some useful links.</P>

<H2>Submission</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Use good object-oriented practices. Methods that do not alter the
class data should be declared <CODE>const</CODE>. Objects should
normally be passed by reference to save on overhead; if a method does
not alter the object, pass a reference to
<CODE>const</CODE> data rather than passing the object by value.</P></LI>

 
<LI><P>You must have a makefile with a rule for compiling an object
file for each source code file.  A linking rule should link all of
your object files together to create one executable. The name of your
final executable should be <CODE>hw3.exe</CODE>. You should also
provide a "clean" rule.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Use the same naming convention as previously for each class
    and header.</P></LI>

<LI><p>A driver program for testing your program can be found here:
<A HREF="hw3.cpp">hw3.cpp</A>. Sample output for this driver can be found here:
<A HREF="hw3-out.txt">hw3-out.txt</A>.</P></LI>

<LI>Your program must follow <i>all</i> the documentation standards
listed on the course web site.</P></LI>

<LI><P>As always, programs that do not compile on <KBD>turing</KBD>
automatically receive 0 points.</P></LI>
      
<LI><P>Submit your project using mailprog.340.  Submit the 6 files
    you have written (3 *.h and 3 *.cpp) plus your makefile.</P></LI>
