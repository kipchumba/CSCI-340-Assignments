<p><i>Updated 4/21/10 to clarify a couple of items. To match the
answers provided and provide realistic times, the sort must be
sequence-preserving, I/O should happen outside of the sort functions,
and you need to use a fresh copy of the input vector for each sort.
Also, the files and a couple of programming tips have been
provided.</i></p>

<H2>Purpose</H2>

<P>This assignment includes the STL heap and priority queue data
structures, and the heapsort and quicksort algorithms. Similar to last
week's, it also incorporates a review of template classes and a
function object.</P>

<H2>Assignment</H2>

<P>For this assignment you will sort an input file using your own
versions of heapsort and quicksort plus several STL sorts, comparing
the CPU time.</P>

<H2>Program</H2>

<H3>Driver</H3>

Your main program should do the following things:

<OL>

<LI>Load the input file into a vector. You may only read the file once.</LI>

<LI>Load the answer file into a vector for comparison purposes.</LI>

<LI>Create a function object for case-independent comparison.</LI>

<LI>For each of the following sorting methods, do the following three
things:</LI>


  <UL>

  <LI>Sort the data using a stable (sequence-preserving) sort. See
  below for a hint on stable sorting.</LI>

  <LI>Print the CPU time. Numbers should have a meaningful title and
  be aligned on the decimal point.</LI>

  <LI>Compare your sorted vector to the answer vector by using the
  appropriate comparison operator (not via a loop). Remember that you
  can say <CODE>v1 == v2</CODE> because the STL provides appropriate
  overloaded operators for you.</LI>

  </UL>

</OL>

<p>Sort the data using each of the following sorting methods. Note
that only methods a) and b) require writing your own code. For the others,
you only need to call the appropriate STL functions.

<OL type="a">

<LI>Sort the data using the heapsort algorithm you have written below.</LI>

<LI>Sort the data using a quicksort algorithm that you have written.</LI>

<LI>Sort the data using the STL <CODE>make_heap</CODE>
and <CODE>sort_heap</CODE> algorithms.

<LI>Sort the data by loading the items into an
STL <CODE>priority_queue</CODE>, then retrieving them.

<LI>Sort the data by calling the STL <CODE>stable_sort</CODE> algorithm.

</OL>

<p>Use a fresh copy of the input vector for each sort so that your
times are fair. Remember that you can copy a vector by saying <CODE>v1
= v2</CODE>, since the STL provides the appropriate overloaded functions.</p>

<H3>Heapsort</H3>

<P>Implement the following template functions in a header file:</P>

<H3><CODE>template &lt;class T, class Pred&gt;<br>
void build_heap(vector&lt;T&gt; &, vector&lt;T&gt; &, Pred);</CODE></H3>

<P>This function should read items from the input <CODE>vector</CODE>
and build a heap structure. The first argument to this function is a
reference to the input <CODE>vector</CODE>. The second argument is a
reference to a <CODE>vector</CODE> for storing the heap structure. The
last argument is a predicate (a Boolean function or class containing
one) for case-independent ascending sort.</P>

<P>The function should iterate over the input vector, inserting them
one at a time into the heap <CODE>vector</CODE>. To insert an
individual item into the heap, call the <CODE>insert()</CODE> function
described below.</P>

<H3><CODE>template &lt;class T, class Pred&gt;<br>
void heapsort(vector&lt;T&gt; &, vector&lt;T&gt; &, Pred);</CODE></H3>

<P>This function should retrieve items from the heap structure and
insert them in sequence into the result vector. The first argument to
this function is a reference to a
<CODE>vector</CODE> that contains the heap structure. The second
argument is a reference to a <CODE>vector</CODE> containing the sorted
results. The last argument is the same predicate as used earlier.</P>

<P>The function should remove items from the heap and print them until
only one item is left in the heap (the sentinel item that occupies the
first vector position). An individual item can be removed from the
heap by calling the <CODE>remove()</CODE> function described
below.</P>

<H3><CODE>template &lt;class T, class Pred&gt;<br>
void insert(vector&lt;T&gt; &, const T &, Pred);</CODE></H3>

<P>This function is used to insert an item (the second argument) into
a heap (the first argument) with the given order (the third
argument). The item can be inserted at the back of the heap using
the <CODE>vector</CODE> method <CODE>push_back()</CODE>. After
insertion, the function <CODE>upheap()</CODE> (see below) should be
called to move the newly inserted item up the heap to its proper
location.</P>

<H3><CODE>template &lt;class T, class Pred&gt;<br>
T remove(vector&lt;T&gt; &, Pred);</CODE></H3>

<P>This function is used to retrieve a single item from the heap
structure (the first argument) with the given order (the second
argument). One possible implementation of this function's logic is as
follows: Swap the first, non-sentinel item in the heap with the last
item in the heap. Obtain the value of the last item in the heap using
the <CODE>vector</CODE> method <CODE>back()</CODE> and save it to be
returned later.  Use the <CODE>vector</CODE>
method <CODE>pop_back()</CODE> to remove the last item from the heap
structure. Call the function <CODE>downheap()</CODE> to move the first
non-sentinel item in the heap down the heap structure to its proper
location.  Finally, return the item retrieved earlier to the calling
function.</P>

<H3><CODE>template &lt;class T, class Pred&gt;<br>
void upheap(vector&lt;T&gt; &, unsigned int, Pred);</CODE></H3>

<P>This function is used to move an item at a given starting index
(the second argument) up a heap structure (the first argument) with
the given order (the third argument) until it reaches its proper
location. The item should be compared (and swapped as necessary) with
its parent in the heap until the given order has been satisfied. Note
that for an item at index <CODE>k</CODE> in the vector, the item's
parent in the heap will be located at index <CODE>k / 2</CODE>.</P>

<P>To make the code for <CODE>upheap()</CODE> function easier, it is
easiest to create the heap vector with a starter element. This
sentinel element will always occupy the first slot of the vector
(index 0); it should not be considered to be part of the heap; and it
should never be removed from the vector.</P>

<H3><CODE>template &lt;class T, class Pred&gt;<br>
void downheap(vector&lt;T&gt; &, unsigned int, Pred);</CODE></H3>

<P>This function is used to move an item at a given starting index
(the second argument) up a heap structure (the first argument) with
the given order (the third argument) until it reaches its proper
location. The item should be compared (and swapped as necessary) with
its appropriate child in the heap until the given order has been
satisfied.

<P>Note that for an item at index <CODE>k</CODE> in the vector, the
item's left child in the heap will be located at index <CODE>2 *
k</CODE> and its right child in the heap will be located at
index <CODE>2 * k + 1</CODE>.</P>

<H2>Programming tips</H2>

<UL>

<LI><p>The predicate should return <CODE>true</CODE> if the first
argument is less than the second in the given order (i.e., in this
case, according to a case-independent ascending comparison). For an
example, see the <CODE>sort2.cpp</CODE> program in the course
directory.</p></LI>

<LI><p>The easiest way to obtain stable sorting is to number the items
as you read them. Then your comparison function should do the
following: if two items have the same key, consider the one with the
lower sequence number to be the lower one. Here are two ways you can
implement that:

  <ul>

  <li>A vector of small objects is one good data structure. The class
  should contain the input string and its sequence number. It does not
  need any dynamic memory. If you use that solution, then you will
  have another <CODE>Obj.h</CODE> file to submit and another entry in
  your <CODE>makefile</CODE>. To compare against the answer vector,
  you can use <CODE>transform</CODE>, <CODE>for_each</CODE>, or a
  loop to strip off the sequence numbers.</li>

  <li>Another approach is to build longer strings from the input
  strings as you read them, e.g., convert <CODE>xyz</CODE>
  to <CODE>xyz&lt;blank&gt;12345</CODE>, where &lt;blank&gt; is a
  space. Note that the numbers must be filled out to five digits in
  order for the comparison to work. If you use this solution, you can
  use string functions to strip off the sequence numbers after the sort.</li>

  </ul>

  </LI>

</UL>

<H2>Standards</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Use good object-oriented practices. Methods that do not alter the
class data should be declared <CODE>const</CODE>. Objects should
normally be passed by reference to save on overhead; if a method does
not alter the object, pass a reference to
<CODE>const</CODE> data rather than passing the object by value.</P></LI>

<LI>Remember that any auxiliary variables you define, such as
iterators, should be local to the function they are used in. They
should not be class members or global variables. Similarly, variables
should not be defined inside a loop.</LI>

<LI><P>You must have a makefile with a rule for compiling an object
file for each source code file. A linking rule should link all of
your object files together to create one executable. The name of your
final executable should be <CODE>hw6.exe</CODE>. You should also
provide a "clean" rule.</P></LI>

<LI>Your program must follow <i>all</i> the documentation standards
listed on the course web site.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Don't forget to get rid of all compiler warnings when the 
<CODE>-Wall</CODE> compilation option is used.</P></LI>

<LI><P>As always, programs that do not compile on <KBD>turing</KBD>
automatically receive 0 points.</P></LI>
      
</UL>


<H2>Submission</H2>

<UL>

<LI><P>Your main program should be entitled <CODE>hw6.cpp</CODE>.</p></LI>

<LI><P>Your heapsort template functions should be stored in the header
file <CODE>heapsort.h</CODE> and your quicksort functions
in <CODE>quicksort.h</CODE>.</P></LI>
 
<LI>Execute your program as <CODE>./hw6.exe rwords.txt swords.txt</CODE>.</P></LI>

<LI><p>A list of words to sort is available at <A HREF="rwords.txt">rwords.txt</A>.
</P></LI>

<LI><p>You can test your output by comparing it to the output of the
Unix <CODE>sort</CODE> command. For your convenience, here is a copy
of the output: <A HREF="swords.txt">swords.txt</A>.</P></LI>

<LI>If you want to run the Unix <CODE>sort</CODE> command yourself,
e.g., for a smaller test file, you need to issue the <CODE>bash</CODE>
commands <CODE>LC_ALL=C</CODE> and <CODE>export LC_ALL</CODE>, or
just <CODE>unset LC_ALL</CODE>, to get an ASCII sort instead of an
English-language sort. Then use <CODE>-f</CODE> ("fold") for
case-independence and <CODE>-s</CODE> for stable sorting. (Even if you
use case-independence, the English-language sort puts special
characters such as the apostrophe and ampersand in unusual places.)

<LI><P>Submit your project using mailprog.340.  Submit the files you
have written,
i.e., <CODE>hw6.cpp</CODE>, <CODE>heapsort.h</CODE>, <CODE>quicksort.h</CODE>,
and your <CODE>makefile</CODE>.</P></LI>
