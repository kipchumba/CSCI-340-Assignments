<HR>


<H2>Purpose</H2>

<P>This assignment includes a review of C++ template classes, the STL
<CODE>list</CODE> class, the concept of function objects, and the hash
table data structure.</P>

<H2>Assignment</H2>
 
<P>Implement a hash table as a C++ template class, using the division
method for the hash function and separate chaining to resolve
collisions. Then write a program that uses your hash table class to
implement a spell-checking dictionary.</P>

<H2>Hash Table Implementation</H2>

<P>You will need to write the header files for two classes:
The <CODE>StringHashKey</CODE> class is a function object that
converts a C++ string into an integer key, and
the <CODE>HashTable</CODE> class implements a hash table using the
division method and separate chaining. The data for the hash table
will be stored in a STL <CODE>vector</CODE> of
STL <CODE>list</CODE>s.</P>

<H3><CODE>class StringHashKey</CODE></H3>

<P>The <CODE>StringHashKey</CODE> class is used to create a function
object that converts a string key to an integer key. This class has no
data members and a single public method, the overloaded
operator <CODE>()</CODE>. The method will take a reference to a
constant string as its single parameter and return an integer. The
method should convert the string parameter into an
integer. There are a number of possible ways to accomplish this; the
logic for one technique is outlined in the pseudocode below:</P>

<PRE>
<I>set an integer sum to 0
for each character in the string
   multiply the sum times 8, then add the value of the current string character
   if the result is greater than 2**27, calculate the remainder mod 2**27
</i>
</pre>
 
<H3><CODE>class HashTable</CODE></H3>

<P>The <CODE>HashTable</CODE> class implements a hash table. This will
be a template class that takes two parameters. The first parameter is
the data type of the items to be stored in the hash table. The second
parameter is a function object to convert an item of the type being
stored into an integer key that can be hashed. The definition for
the <CODE>HashTable</CODE> class should be placed in the
<CODE>HashTable.h</CODE> header file. Because this is a template class, 
the code for the methods of the class should also be placed in the 
header file.</P>

<P>A <CODE>HashTable</CODE> contains four data members. The first is an
integer that contains the number of pointers to linked lists in the hash
table; these pointers represent the buckets of the hash table. The second
is an integer that contains the number of data items currently stored in
the hash table. The third is a function object of the type of the second
template parameter which will convert a data item to an integer hash key.  
The fourth data member is the <CODE>vector</CODE> of linked-list buckets,
which should be declared as follows:</P>

<PRE>
   vector &lt;list&lt;T&gt; &gt; buckets;
</PRE>

<P>where <CODE>T</CODE> is the first template class parameter. Note
the space between the two &gt; symbols - it
is <STRONG>required</STRONG>. Failure to include it will cause a
syntax error.</P>

<H3><CODE>HashTable</CODE> constructor</H3>

<P>The constructor for the class should take a single parameter, an
integer specifying the number of buckets. The constructor should set
the number of buckets to this parameter, set the size to 0,
and create the <CODE>vector</CODE> of buckets. You may need to use the
member initialization syntax for the latter.</P>

<P>Even though this class involves dynamic memory, you do not need to
write a copy constructor, destructor, or overloaded assignment
operator for it because all of the dynamically-allocated storage for
the hash table is managed by the embedded STL container classes, which
already have the appropriate methods implemented for them.</P>

<H3><CODE>HashTable clear()</CODE> method</H3>

<P>This method returns nothing and takes no parameters. It clears the
hash table, releasing all of the dynamic memory associated with
it. The method should reset the size to 0 and
call the <CODE>clear()</CODE> method for the <CODE>vector</CODE> of
buckets.</P>

<H3><CODE>HashTable size()</CODE> method</H3>

<P>This method takes no parameters. It returns the number of data
items currently stored in the hash table.</P>

<H3><CODE>HashTable bucketsUsed()</CODE> method</H3>

<P>This method takes no parameters. It returns the number of buckets
currently in use in the hash table, i.e., the number of non-empty lists.</P>

<H3><CODE>HashTable maxLength()</CODE> method</H3>

<P>This method takes no parameters. It returns the maximum length of
any list currently in the hash table.</P>

<H3><CODE>HashTable empty()</CODE> method</H3>

<P>This method takes no parameters. It returns <CODE>true</CODE> if the hash table
contains no data items; otherwise it returns <CODE>false</CODE>.</P>

<H3><CODE>HashTable insert()</CODE> method</H3>

<P>This method returns a Boolean value and takes a single parameter, a
reference to a constant item of the first template parameter type (the
item to insert). The method should "call" the hash key function
object, passing it the item to insert. The integer returned by the
function object should be divided by the number of buckets; the
remainder is the hash value, which can be used as an index to a
particular bucket in the <CODE>vector</CODE> of buckets. You should
perform a linear search of the linked list associated with that
bucket. If the item to be inserted is already present in the linked
list, return
<CODE>false</CODE>. Otherwise, insert the item into the list for that bucket, 
increment the size of the hash table, and return <CODE>true</CODE>.</P>

<H3><CODE>HashTable find()</CODE> method</H3>

<P>This method returns a Boolean value and takes a single parameter, a
reference to a constant item of the first template parameter type (the
item to find). The method does not alter the hash table data. The
method should "call" the hash key function object, passing it the item
to insert. The integer returned by the function object should be
divided by the number of buckets; the remainder is the hash value,
which can be used as an index to a particular bucket in the
<CODE>vector</CODE> of buckets. You should perform a linear search of
the linked list associated with that bucket. If the item to be found
is present in that bucket, return <CODE>true</CODE>; otherwise return
<CODE>false</CODE>.</P>

<H2>Program</H2>

<P>In the second part of this assignment, you will write a main
program that uses your hash table class. The main program will
simulate the logic of the Linux utility <i>ispell</i>.</p>

<p>The program will take three command line parameters: the number of
buckets in the hash table, the name of the dictionary file, and a file
of words to spell check.</p>

<p>There are three possible outputs for each word:</p>

<ul>

<li>"OK" means that the word is in the dictionary.</li>

<li>"Not found" means that the word is not in the dictionary
and neither are any of its near misses.</li>

<li>Otherwise, print a list of near misses in alphabetical order. Near
misses are words in the dictionary that are similar to the input.
The <i>ispell</i> program recognizes several types of near-misses:
single-letter omissions, single-letter additions, transpositions of
two neighboring letters, substitution of one letter for another, and
two words run together. Your program should do the same. The easiest
way to sort the possible corrections is to store them in
a <CODE>list</CODE> of <CODE>string</CODE>s. Then you can use the
<CODE>sort</CODE> member function of <CODE>list</CODE>.


(The
algorithm described below is a simplified form of the spelling
algorithm used by most word processors today and first described
in <A HREF="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C90-2036">Kernighan's
COLING '90 paper</A>.)</li>

</ul>

<P>We will provide you with a file of about 25,000 words to use as a
dictionary. You should test with a much smaller dictionary first. Read
the dictionary file and add the words to a hash table of the specified
number of buckets. Convert each word to lower case first.</p>

<p>After the dictionary is loaded, print the following information
about it, one per line, properly aligned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Number of entries</li>

<li>Number of buckets in the hash table</li>

<li>Number of buckets in use</li>

<li>Average length of list (round to two decimal places)</li>

<li>Maximum length of list</li>

<li>Time needed to load the dictionary</li>

</ul>

</p>Then read the file specified in the second argument. Convert each
word to lower case, then check to see whether it is in the dictionary.
If so, it should print "ok".  If not, it should look for all possible
near misses. If the program finds any near misses in the dictionary,
it should print them in alphabetical order, four across. If not, it
should print "not found". (Make sure you print the original word
first!)</P>

<P>To search for near misses, you need to generate every possible near
miss and look for it in the dictionary. Specifically:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Construct every string that can be made by deleting one letter from the word. 
(<CODE>n</CODE> possibilities, where <CODE>n</CODE> is the length of the word)</LI>

<LI>Construct every string that can be made by inserting any letter of the alphabet 
at any position in the string. (<CODE>26*(n+1)</CODE> possibilities)</LI>

<LI>Construct every string that can be made by swapping two neighboring characters 
in the string. (<CODE>n-1</CODE> possibilities)</LI>

<LI>Construct every string that can be made by replacing each letter in the word 
with some letter of the alphabet. (<CODE>26*n</CODE> possibilities, including 
<CODE>n</CODE> times for replacing the letter by itself, which may be
easier than trying to bypass this case)</LI>

<LI>Construct every <EM>pair</EM> of strings that can be made by
inserting a space into the word. (<CODE>n-1</CODE> pairs of words; you
have to check separately in the dictionary for each word in the
pair. The pair of words is a near miss only if both words are in the
dictionary)</LI>

</UL>

<p>At the end of your program, print the time needed to spell check
the file.</p>

<H2>Programming Notes</H2>

<UL>

<LI><P>The declaration of an iterator for a container class that
stores a generic template parameter data type requires the addition of
the keyword <CODE>typename</CODE>, e.g.:</P>

<PRE>
typename list&lt;T&gt;::iterator iter;
</PRE></LI>

<LI><P>In your main program, the data type of your hash table dictionary will be 
<CODE>HashTable&lt;string,StringHashKey&gt;</CODE>. Since this is rather lengthy, 
you may want to use the <CODE>typedef</CODE> instruction to create a shorter
alias for this data type to save on typing, e.g.:</P>

<PRE>typedef HashTable&lt;string,StringHashKey&gt; NewName;</PRE>
</LI> 

<LI><P>Use STL algorithms wherever possible. For example, you can use
the <CODE>transform</CODE> function to convert the input word to lower
case. You can use <CODE>for_each</CODE> or another algorithm to
calculate the hash key. You can use the STL <CODE>find</CODE>
algorithm to search a linked list. You will have to refer to it
as <CODE>stl::find</CODE> to avoid ambiguity with
the <CODE>find</CODE> method of the hash table.</P></LI>

<LI>This web site explains how to obtain CPU time:
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/CPU-Time.html">
CPU time calculation</A>. CLOCKS_PER_SEC is a constant defined in the
#include. It is 1,000,000 on turing, which means that the system
measures times to the nearest millionth of a second. That means that a
total time less than one millionth of a second will appear to be
0.</p>

<p>In a real-world example, you want to keep the average length of an
overflow chain less than 1, i.e., you want plenty of extra space in
your hash table. We are trying this hash table with some
unrealistically small sizes (e.g., 97) so you can see the huge time
difference between a too-small hash table and a more realistic
one.</p></li>

<li><p>Here is an example of using a class variable in a template that
will be filled in with the name of a function object at compile time:</p>

<pre>

template &lt;class T, class HF&gt;
class HashTable
   {
    ...
   };


template &lt;class T, class HF&gt;
HashTable&lt;T, HF&gt;::HashTable(int nb) : buckets(nb)
  {
    ...
  }
</pre>

<p>You can define variables of type <CODE>T</CODE> or <CODE>HF</CODE>:</p>

<pre>
T my_vbl;
HF my_hashfn;
</pre>

<p>The program that declares an instance of the class needs to provide
actual values for the class variables, e.g.:</p>

<pre>
HashTable&lt;string, StringHash&gt; dictionary(bucket_count);
</pre>

<p>The variables <CODE>T</CODE> and <CODE>HF</CODE> in the class
definition are filled in with your choices at compile time, just as an
STL class like <CODE>list</CODE> might be instantiated
as <CODE>list&lt;int&gt;</CODE> when you write your code. Remember that if a
class is defined with a template, all of its members must use the same
template. For an example of the syntax, see the following example from
241:
<A HREF = "http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~freedman/241/link03-template-below.cpp">
template example</A></LI>


<li><p>The ":" in the example above is an example of member initialization
syntax. You could initialize all your variables with this syntax if
you prefer, e.g.: <CODE>buckets(nb), bucketsUsedCount(0),</CODE>...
It's actually more efficient to do it that way. For a nested STL
type like <CODE>vector<list></CODE>, it's required.</p></LI>

<li><p>The purpose of declaring a function object and overloading the "()"
operator is to let you use the normal calling sequence for a function
whose name is a variable. For example, using the example above you could
write <CODE>my_hashfn(input)</CODE>.</p></LI>

</UL>

      
<H2>Standards</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Use good object-oriented practices. Methods that do not alter the
class data should be declared <CODE>const</CODE>. Objects should
normally be passed by reference to save on overhead; if a method does
not alter the object, pass a reference to
<CODE>const</CODE> data rather than passing the object by value.</P></LI>

<LI>Remember that any auxiliary variables you define, such as
iterators, should be local to the function they are used in. They
should not be class members or global variables. Similarly, variables
should not be defined inside a loop.</LI>

<LI><P>You must have a makefile with a rule for compiling an object
file for each source code file. A linking rule should link all of
your object files together to create one executable. The name of your
final executable should be <CODE>hw5.exe</CODE>. You should also
provide a "clean" rule.</P></LI>

<LI>Your program must follow <i>all</i> the documentation standards
listed on the course web site.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Don't forget to get rid of all compiler warnings when the 
<CODE>-Wall</CODE> compilation option is used.</P></LI>

<LI><P>As always, programs that do not compile on <KBD>turing</KBD>
automatically receive 0 points.</P></LI>
      
</UL>


<H2>Extensions</H2>

<p>You can improve the performance of your program by using binary
search instead of linear search. Another option would be to
use <CODE>map</CODE>s to store the contents of the buckets. The STL
makes it possible to try these changes with very little programming.</p>

<H2>Submission</H2>

<UL>

<LI><p>A dictionary is available at <A HREF="dict.txt">dict.txt</A>.
</P></LI>

<LI><p>Here is a sample input <A HREF="words.txt">words.txt</A> to
spell check. Here are three outputs showing the effect of the hash
table size:
<A HREF="hw5-out97.txt">hw5-out97.txt</A> 
<A HREF="hw5-out997.txt">hw5-out997.txt</A> 
<A HREF="hw5-out9973.txt">hw5-out9973.txt</A>.
(Note that the format is not exactly what you have been requested to produce.)</p>

<p>The word "assert" occurs three times in the output because
"asssert" can be corrected to "assert" three ways depending on which
's' is deleted. The duplicates have been left in so that you can see
whether your program is working correctly. In a real-world application
you would delete the duplicates because they are not meaningful to the
user.</p>

<p>The output also shows some other spell-check issues that you would
have to deal with to get a professional-quality program. The letters
of the alphabet might occur in a document, and Lund is a city in
Sweden, but that doesn't mean that "b lund" is a very likely
correction for "blund." You could add rules to restrict the possible
pairs of words, or you could do as most spell checkers do today, and
sort the corrections by probability of occurrence.</P></LI>

<p>Note that you need to hash the input, <i>not</i> do a linear (or
binary) search through the dictionary, to get correct timings.</P></LI>

<LI><p>Execute your program as <CODE>./hw5.exe
buckets dictionary.txt words.txt</CODE>.</P></LI>

<LI>Run your program 3 times, using 97, 997 and 9973 buckets,
respectively. Make sure your output is the same except for the
times. Compare the times.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Submit your project using mailprog.340. Submit the 3 files you
have written plus your makefile. There are only three
(<CODE>hw5.cpp</CODE>, <CODE>HashTable.h</CODE>,
and <CODE>StringHash.h</CODE>) because code for template classes and
functions needs to be in the <CODE>.h</CODE> file.</P></LI>
