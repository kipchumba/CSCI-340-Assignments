<HR>
 
<p><i>Corrections and clarifications noted with ***. There are three
clarifications to the writeup, plus a correction to the calculation of
the team statistics. You can compare to the <A HREF="hw1-orig.html">original
version</A>.</i></p>

<H2>Purpose</H2>

<P>This assignment covers inheritance and polymorphism. It also
  contains a review of arrays and pointers and a makefile.</P>

<H2>Assignment</H2>
 
<P>For this project, you will create a series of classes designed to provide 
support for a simple database of baseball players. If you are not familiar 
with the sport of baseball, do not be concerned - this writeup should teach 
you everything you need to know to get the project done.</P> 

<H3>BaseballPlayer Class Hierarchy</H3>

<P>First, you are to create an <EM>abstract base class</EM> 
<B>BaseballPlayer</B>.  Every <B>BaseballPlayer</B> has</P>

<UL>
<LI>a <TT>name</TT>, which is of type <TT>string</TT> (this is the
  C++ <TT>string</TT> class, <i>not</i> a C-string implemented as an array),</LI> 
<LI>a <TT>height</TT>, which is of type <TT>int</TT>,</LI> 
<LI>and a <TT>weight</TT>, which is of type <TT>int</TT>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>A <B>Pitcher</B> is a <B>BaseballPlayer</B> with the following additional 
data members:</P>

<UL>
<LI>a <TT>throws</TT> data member which is a <TT>char</TT> (representing right- 
or left-handed),</LI>
<LI>the number of <TT>inningsPitched</TT> the pitcher has recorded, which is an 
<TT>float</TT>,</LI> 
<LI>the number of <TT>earnedRuns</TT> the pitcher has allowed, which is an 
<TT>int</TT>,</LI> 
<LI>and the pitcher's <TT>ERA</TT> (Earned Run Average), which is a 
<TT>float</TT> (instructions for calculating this are given later).</LI>
</UL>

<P>You should also define a symbolic constant <TT>THROWS_UNINITIALIZED</TT> and 
set it to <TT>'U'</TT>.</P>

<P>You are also to derive a <B>Hitter</B> class from <B>BaseballPlayer</B> 
with the following additional data members:</P>
 
<UL>
<LI>a <TT>bats</TT> data member, which is a <TT>char</TT> that 
indicates whether the hitter bats right-handed, left-handed, or both (for a 
switch hitter),</LI> 
<LI>an <TT>atBats</TT> field, which is an <TT>int</TT> that gives the 
number of plate appearances for the player,</LI> 
<LI>a number of <TT>hits</TT>, which is an <TT>int</TT>,</LI> 
<LI>and a <TT>batAvg</TT>, which is a <TT>float</TT> (again, defined 
later).</LI>
</UL>

<P>You should also define a symbolic constant <TT>BATS_UNINITIALIZED</TT> and 
set it to <TT>'U'</TT>.</P>

<P>Now that the implementation details of this hierarchy have been 
discussed, the interface may be specified.</P>

<P>The <B>BaseballPlayer</B> class should have the following methods:</P> 

<UL>
<LI><P>a constructor that takes a <TT>string</TT>, and two <TT>ints</TT> as 
arguments. It initializes <TT>name</TT> to <TT>""</TT>, <TT>weight</TT> to 
0, and <TT>height</TT> to 0 if the corresponding parameters are not passed 
in. This constructor will only be invoked via a derived-class 
constructor.</P></LI>
<LI><P>a <EM>get_name</EM> member function that takes no arguments and 
provides <I>read-only</I> access to the player's name.</P></LI>
<LI><P>a <EM>pure virtual member function</EM> called <EM>print_player</EM> 
that takes no arguments and is defined in its derived classes.</P></LI> 
<LI><P>a <EM>pure virtual member function</EM> called <EM>load_player</EM> 
that takes a single parameter that is a reference to an <TT>ifstream</TT> 
and is defined in its derived classes</P></LI>
</UL>

<P>The <B>Pitcher</B> class should have the following methods:</P>

<UL>

<LI><P>a constructor that takes a <TT>string</TT>, two <TT>int</TT>s,
a <TT>char</TT>, a <TT>float</TT> and another <TT>int</TT> as arguments. It should
use a base-class member initializer to set variables inherited from
the base class. The other arguments should default to
<TT>THROWS_UNINITIALIZED</TT> (for the <TT>char</TT>) or 0. The constructor should 
also call the utility function described below to compute the pitcher's ERA.</P></LI>

<LI><P>a private <EM>utility</EM> member function that returns a pitcher's 
earned run average. ERA is computed as <TT>earnedRuns / inningsPitched * 9.0</TT>.
If a pitcher has no innings pitched, return a 999.99 ERA.</P></LI>

<LI><P>a <EM>virtual</EM> member function called <EM>print_player</EM> that 
takes no arguments and prints the fact that the player is a pitcher along 
with all of the data members of a pitcher object with appropriate labels. 
For example,</P>

<PRE>
Pitcher -
Name: Maddux,Gregg
Height: 72 inches
Weight: 170 pounds
Throws: R
Earned Runs: 95
Innings Pitched: 212.667
ERA: 4.02
</PRE></LI>

<LI><P>a <EM>virtual</EM> member function called <EM>load_player</EM> which 
takes a single parameter that is a reference to an <TT>ifstream</TT>. It 
reads the following fields from the <TT>ifstream</TT> object passed into 
it:</P>

<UL>
<LI>a pitcher's name to be stored in <TT>name</TT></LI> 
<LI>a pitcher's height in inches to be stored in <TT>height</TT></LI>
<LI>a pitcher's weight in pounds to be stored in <TT>weight</TT></LI>
<LI>the hand with which a pitcher throws (<TT>'R'</TT> or <TT>'L'</TT>) 
to be stored in <TT>throws</TT> 
<LI>the number of earned runs the pitcher has allowed to be stored in 
<TT>earnedRuns</TT></LI>
<LI>the number of innings pitched the pitcher has recorded to be stored in 
<TT>inningsPitched</TT></LI>
</UL>

</UL>

<P>You may assume that all values are on a single line of input in a text 
file and that the values in the file are valid. Note that the <TT>ERA</TT> 
is NOT read in from the input stream; the <EM>load_player</EM> function should instead
call the private utility function described above to compute and store
the pitcher's ERA.</P></LI> 

<P>The <B>Hitter</B> class should have the following methods:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>a constructor that takes a <TT>string</TT>, two <TT>int</TT>s, a <TT>char</TT>,
and two more <TT>int</TT>s as arguments. It should use a base-class member initializer 
to set variables inherited from the base class. The other arguments should default to 
<TT>BATS_UNINITIALIZED</TT> (for the <TT>char</TT>) or 0. The constructor should 
also call the utility function described below to compute the hitter's batting 
average.</P></LI> 

<LI><P>a private <EM>utility</EM> member function that returns a hitter's 
batting average. Batting average is computed as <TT>hits / atBats</TT>.
If a hitter has no at bats, return a 0 batting average.</P></LI>

<LI><P>a <EM>virtual</EM> member function called <EM>print_player</EM> that 
takes no arguments and prints the fact that the player is a hitter along 
with all of the data members of a hitter object with appropriate labels. 
For example,</P>

<PRE>
Hitter -
Name: Bonds,Barry
Height: 74 inches
Weight: 228 pounds
Bats: L
Hits: 135
At Bats: 373
Batting Average: .362
</PRE></LI>

<LI><P>a <EM>virtual</EM> member function called <EM>load_player</EM> which 
takes a single parameter that is a reference to an <TT>ifstream</TT>. It 
reads the following fields from the <TT>ifstream</TT> object passed into 
it:</P>

<UL>
<LI>a hitter's name to be stored in <TT>name</TT></LI> 
<LI>a hitter's height in inches to be stored in <TT>height</TT></LI>
<LI>a hitter's weight in pounds to be stored in <TT>weight</TT></LI>
<LI>the side of the plate that a hitter bats from (<TT>'R'</TT>, 
<TT>'L'</TT>, or <TT>'B'</TT>) to be stored in <TT>bats</TT></LI> 
<LI>the number of hits the hitter has obtained to be stored in 
<TT>hits</TT></LI>
<LI>the number of times the hitter has been at bat to be stored in 
<TT>atBats</TT></LI>
</UL>
 
<P>You may assume that all values are on a single line of input in a text 
file and that the values in the file are valid. Note that the <TT>batAvg</TT> 
is NOT read in from the input stream; the <EM>load_player</EM> function should instead
call the private utility function described above to compute and store the hitter's 
batting average.</P></LI> 

</UL>

<P>A final note on the <TT>BaseballPlayer</TT> hierarchy: Every class in the 
hierarchy should contain a <I>virtual</I> destructor. This will ensure that 
when the <B>PlayerDatabase</B>'s destructor (see below) is called to delete 
all of the elements in the <TT>team</TT> array, the correct destructor will 
be called for each player. Note that the destructors do not actually have 
to take any action explicitly - they can each have empty function bodies.</P>

<p>*** These virtual destructors are an exception to the Rule of 3
(the rule that says that you either need all three of the destructor,
the overloaded assignment operator, and the copy constructor, or none
of them, and you need all three if the constructor uses any dynamic
memory.</p>.

<P>You should build and test the hierarchy with your own <EM>main</EM> 
before moving on to the next part.</P>

<H3>The PlayerDatabase Class</H3>

<P>Now that you are able create and load individual players, you 
can move on to storing an entire team. You will create a class called 
<B>PlayerDatabase</B> which has the following data members:</P>

<UL>
<LI>an <TT>int</TT> called <I>team_count</I> that represents the
number of members on the team.</LI>

<LI>an array of pointers to <B>BaseballPlayer</B>s.</LI>
</UL> 

<P>The class should have the following member functions:</P> 

<UL>

<LI><P>a <EM>destructor</EM> that deletes every element of the <TT>team</TT> 
array that points to an object and then resets <i>team_count</i>.</P></LI>
 
<LI><P>*** an <EM>overloaded assignment operator</EM> and a <EM>copy
constructor</EM> required because the constructor uses dynamic
memory. Each should correctly allocate and copy the dynamic
memory. The assignment operator should also perform the
self-assignment check.</P></LI>
 
<LI><P>*** a member function called <EM>print_team</EM> that takes no
arguments and prints the entire team by traversing the <TT>team</TT>
array and calling <EM>print_player</EM> for every element. After all
players have been printed, the function should print the team batting
average (total hits divided by total at-bats) and the team ERA (total
earned runs divided by the total innings pitched, multiplied by
9).</P></LI>
 
<LI><P>a member function called <EM>load_team</EM> that takes a single 
parameter that is a reference to an <TT>ifstream</TT>. This function reads 
the file referenced by <TT>ifstream</TT> one line at a time. It reads the 
first character of each line explicitly. If that character is a 
<TT>'P'</TT>, <EM>load_team</EM> should create a pointer to a newly 
allocated empty <B>Pitcher</B> object, and then call the 
<TT>load_player</TT> member function of the newly created object to read 
the rest of the line containing information on the pitcher. Similarly, if 
that character is an <TT>'H'</TT>, <EM>load_team</EM> should create a 
pointer to an newly allocated empty <B>Hitter</B> object, and then call 
the <TT>load_player</TT> member function of the newly created object to 
read the rest of the line containing information on the hitter. In either 
case, the pointer to the object should then be inserted in the next
available slot in the <TT>team</TT> array. You will need to typecast
the pointer to <B>BaseballPlayer *</B>.
Here are two example entries in a typical team data file:</P>

<PRE>
P Maddux,Gregg 72 170 R 95 212.667
H Bonds,Barry 74 228 L 135 373
</PRE></LI>

</UL>

<H2>Other Points</H2>

<UL>

<LI><P>You must have a makefile with a rule for compiling an object
file for each source code file.  A linking rule should link all of
your object files together to create one executable. The name of your
final executable should be <CODE>hw1.exe</CODE>. You should also
provide a "clean" rule.</P></LI>

<LI><P>The <B>BaseballPlayer</B> class declarations should be placed in a 
file called <U>BaseballPlayer.h</U>; its member function definitions should 
be placed in <U>BaseballPlayer.cpp</U>, and similarly for <B>Pitcher</B>, 
<B>Hitter</B>, and <B>PlayerDatabase</B>.</LI>

<LI>A driver program for testing your database can be found here:
<A HREF="hw1.cpp">hw1.cpp</A></P>

<P>A short file used for input by the driver program may be found here:
<A HREF="players-mini.txt">players-mini.txt</A>. The output for this
file is <A HREF="output-mini.txt">output-mini.txt</A>.</P> 

<P>A more realistic one can be found here:
<A HREF="players-orig.txt">players-orig.txt</A>. The output for this
file is <A HREF="output-orig.txt">output-orig.txt</A>.</LI>

<LI>You program must follow all the documentation standards listed on
the course web site. Don't forget to get rid of all compiler warnings when the 
<CODE>-Wall</CODE> compilation option is used.</LI>

<LI><P>As always, programs that do not compile on <KBD>turing</KBD>
automatically receive 0 points.</P></LI>
      
<LI><P>Submit your program using the electronic submission guidelines
posted on the course web site and discussed in class.<br>
*** Submit the 8 class files (4 *.h and 4 *.cpp) plus your
makefile.</P></LI>

<LI>You will be adding functions to this program in Assignment 2, so
you must complete this program even if it is too late to receive credit.</LI>
